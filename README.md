## Running Unit Tests

```gulp test```



This app uses [Karma](https://www.npmjs.com/package/karma), [Jasmine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine), [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) and [Angular Mocks](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngMock) for unit testing. 


## Gulp

[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is a task runner that is used here to concatenate and minify JavaScript and CSS files, and run unit tests. 

A useful developer task is ```gulp watch```. This automatically runs the gulp tasks every time a change is made to the app, allowing you to continuously and automatically update your JavaScript and CSS and run unit tests continuously.
